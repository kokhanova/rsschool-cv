#About me: I have 7 years of experience working in a bank. I have worked with ordinary clients, VIP clients and small business companies, so I have well-developed soft skills. 3 years ago, I went on maternity leave and started working freelance. Most of all I liked to make up sites on Tilda. So at the beginning of this year I realized that I wanted to be able to do something more than just collect sites on Tilda. Now I have been studying JavaScript for 4 months and plan to become a master of my craft.

#Skills: HTML5, CSS4, JavaScript Basics, Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma

#Code Example: Task "Coding in function trueOrFalse, function accept 1 parameters:val, try to use the conditional statement if...else, if val value is false (val==false or it can convert to false), should return a string "false", if not, return a string "true"."

                            " function trueOrFalse(val){
                            if (val) return 'true'; 
                            else return 'false';
                            } "
